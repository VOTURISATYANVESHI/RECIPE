    <h1>Chapati Recipe</h1>
    <div class="recipe">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>Water (for kneading)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure:</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>In a mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour and, if desired, salt.</li>
            <li>Gradually add water while kneading the flour to form a soft, smooth, and non-sticky dough. The amount of water may vary, so add it little by little until you achieve the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax and makes rolling the chapatis easier.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small, equal-sized portions and shape them into round balls. You can make them slightly larger than a golf ball.</li>
            <li>Take one dough ball and roll it into a smooth ball between your palms. Flatten it slightly to form a small disk.</li>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough ball into a thin, round chapati. You can dust the rolling surface with a little dry flour to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Heat a flat griddle or tava over medium-high heat. Once hot, place the rolled chapati on the griddle and cook for about 20-30 seconds on one side until small bubbles start to appear.</li>
            <li>Flip the chapati and cook the other side for about 20-30 seconds until it puffs up and develops golden brown spots.</li>
            <li>Remove the cooked chapati from the griddle and keep it warm by wrapping it in a clean cloth or aluminum foil while you cook the remaining chapatis.</li>
            <li>Your homemade Chapatis (Rotis) are ready to be served! Enjoy them with your favorite curry or side dish.</li>
