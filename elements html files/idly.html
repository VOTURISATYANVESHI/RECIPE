    <div class="recipe">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 cup parboiled rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup urad dal (black gram)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (methi)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup poha (flattened rice)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure:</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Wash and rinse the parboiled rice, urad dal, fenugreek seeds, and poha separately in water. Soak them in water separately for about 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Drain the water from the soaked ingredients and grind them separately into a smooth paste using a little water. The urad dal paste should be fluffy, and the rice paste should be smooth.</li>
            <li>Combine both the urad dal and rice pastes in a mixing bowl. Add salt and mix well. The batter should be thick but with a pouring consistency. Cover the bowl and let it ferment for about 8-10 hours or overnight in a warm place.</li>
            <li>Grease the idli molds with a little oil or ghee. Pour the fermented batter into the molds, filling them about three-fourths full.</li>
            <li>Steam the idlis in a steamer for about 10-15 minutes until they are cooked and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the idlis from the molds using a spoon. They should come out easily if properly greased.</li>
            <li>Your soft and fluffy Idlis are ready to be served! Enjoy them with your favorite chutney and sambar.</li>
