        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
            <li>1 cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>A pinch of baking soda</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped almonds (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure:</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, add ghee and melt it over low heat.</li>
            <li>Add gram flour (besan) to the melted ghee and roast it on low heat. Keep stirring continuously to avoid lumps and ensure even roasting. This may take about 15-20 minutes until it turns golden brown and gives off a nutty aroma. Remove from heat and set it aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate saucepan, combine sugar and water to make a sugar syrup. Bring it to a boil and simmer for about 5-7 minutes to form a one-string consistency syrup.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour the sugar syrup into the roasted gram flour while stirring continuously. Add cardamom powder and a pinch of baking soda. Mix well to combine. The mixture will thicken quickly, so work efficiently.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture onto a greased surface like a plate or a tray. Flatten it using a rolling pin while it's still warm to achieve a uniform thickness. Optionally, sprinkle chopped almonds on top and gently press them in.</li>
            <li>Let the mixture cool for a few minutes, then cut it into square or diamond-shaped pieces while it's still warm. Allow it to cool completely and set.</li>
            <li>Your delicious Soan Papdi is ready to be enjoyed! Store it in an airtight container for later consumption.</li>
