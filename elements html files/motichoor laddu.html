    <h1>Motichoor Laddu Recipe</h1>
    <div class="recipe">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melon seeds (magaz)</li>
            <li>Ghee for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure:</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>In a mixing bowl, add gram flour and mix it with water to form a smooth, thick batter. The batter should be of pouring consistency but not too thin.</li>
            <li>Heat ghee for frying in a deep pan or kadai over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Using a perforated ladle or a slotted spoon, pour the gram flour batter through the holes into the hot ghee. Fry the tiny boondi until they turn golden brown. Remove the fried boondi from the ghee and drain excess oil on a paper towel. Repeat this process until all the batter is used.</li>
            <li>In a separate saucepan, combine sugar and water to make a sugar syrup. Bring it to a boil and simmer for about 5-7 minutes to form a one-string consistency syrup. Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using) to the syrup. Set it aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the fried boondi and melon seeds. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Gradually pour the prepared sugar syrup over the boondi while stirring continuously. Ensure that all the boondi are coated with the syrup.</li>
            <li>Add ghee to the mixture and continue to mix until it forms a sticky and lumpy mass.</li>
            <li>While the mixture is still warm, shape it into small, round laddus (ladoos) using your hands. You can grease your hands with a little ghee to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Allow the laddus to cool completely before serving.</li>
            <li>Your delicious Motichoor Laddus are ready to be enjoyed!</li>
