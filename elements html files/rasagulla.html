    <h1>Rasgulla Recipe</h1>
    <div class="recipe">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 liter full-fat milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup lemon juice or white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>A few saffron strands (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure:</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>Boil the milk in a heavy-bottomed pan, stirring continuously to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat and add lemon juice or white vinegar gradually while stirring. The milk will curdle, and whey will separate from the curdled milk solids.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and strain the curdled milk through a muslin cloth or cheesecloth to separate the chenna (paneer) from the whey. Rinse the chenna under cold running water to remove any residual lemon or vinegar flavor.</li>
            <li>Gather the cloth with the chenna and squeeze out excess water. Hang the chenna bundle for about 30 minutes to drain any remaining water.</li>
            <li>After draining, transfer the chenna to a clean surface and knead it with the heel of your hand until it becomes smooth and soft. This may take about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide the kneaded chenna into equal-sized portions and shape them into smooth balls without any cracks. Ensure there are no cracks, or the rasgullas may break during cooking.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, combine sugar, water, cardamom powder, and saffron strands (if using). Bring the sugar syrup to a boil.</li>
            <li>Gently add the chenna balls (rasgullas) to the boiling sugar syrup. Cover the saucepan with a lid and cook on medium heat for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>The rasgullas will expand in size as they cook and absorb the sugar syrup. They should double in size and become spongy.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and let the rasgullas cool in the sugar syrup for a few hours. As they cool, they will soak up more syrup and become even softer.</li>
            <li>Your delicious Rasgullas are ready to be served! You can refrigerate them and enjoy them chilled.</li>
