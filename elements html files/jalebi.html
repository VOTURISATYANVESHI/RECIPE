    <div class="recipe">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons gram flour (besan)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup yogurt (curd)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
            <li>Oil or ghee for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure:</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, gram flour, yogurt, and baking soda. Mix well to form a smooth batter. Let it rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a separate saucepan, combine sugar and water to make a sugar syrup. Bring it to a boil and simmer for about 5-7 minutes until it reaches a one-string consistency. Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using). Set the sugar syrup aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium heat. You can use a jalebi dispenser or a piping bag to make jalebi shapes. If using a plastic bottle as a dispenser, make a small hole in the cap.</li>
            <li>Fill the jalebi dispenser with the prepared batter.</li>
            <li>Squeeze the batter into the hot oil in a circular motion to make spiral shapes. Fry until the jalebis are golden and crisp, flipping them to ensure even cooking. This may take about 2-3 minutes per batch.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried jalebis from the oil and immediately dip them into the sugar syrup. Let them soak in the syrup for a few seconds to absorb the sweetness.</li>
            <li>Remove the jalebis from the syrup and place them on a plate to cool. Repeat the process for the remaining batter.</li>
            <li>Your delicious Jalebis are ready to be served. Enjoy them warm or at room temperature!</li>
