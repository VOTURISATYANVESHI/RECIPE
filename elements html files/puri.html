    <div class="recipe">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 cups whole wheat flour (atta)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ghee or oil</li>
            <li>Water (for kneading)</li>
            <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure:</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Add ghee or oil to the flour mixture and rub it in with your fingertips until it resembles bread crumbs.</li>
            <li>Gradually add water while kneading the flour to form a smooth and firm dough. Knead for about 5 minutes until the dough is soft and elastic. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small, equal-sized portions and shape them into round balls. Roll each ball between your palms to make them smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly with your fingertips. Roll it out into a small circle, about 4-5 inches in diameter. The poori should not be too thin or too thick.</li>
            <li>Gently slide the rolled poori into the hot oil and press it lightly with a slotted spoon. It should puff up. Fry until it turns golden brown on both sides, turning it as needed.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried poori from the oil using a slotted spoon and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat the process for the remaining dough balls.</li>
            <li>Your delicious Pooris are ready to be served! Enjoy them with your favorite side dishes like potato masala or chana masala.</li>
