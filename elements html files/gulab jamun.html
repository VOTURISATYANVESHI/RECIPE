        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>A pinch of cardamom powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons yogurt</li>
            <li>2 cups sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>A few saffron strands (optional)</li>
            <li>Rosewater or cardamom essence (a few drops, optional)</li>
            <li>Oil or ghee for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure:</h2>
        <ol class="instructions">
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, ghee, baking soda, cardamom powder, and yogurt. Mix well to form a soft dough. If the dough is too dry, you can add a little milk to make it soft.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into small equal-sized portions and shape them into smooth balls without any cracks. Ensure that there are no cracks on the surface of the balls.</li>
            <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.</li>
            <li>Gently slide the prepared dough balls into the hot oil and fry them on low to medium heat until they turn golden brown. Stir occasionally for even frying. It may take about 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the dough balls are frying, prepare the sugar syrup. In a separate saucepan, combine sugar, water, and saffron strands (if using). Bring to a boil, then simmer for about 5-7 minutes to form a slightly sticky syrup. Add rosewater or cardamom essence if desired and simmer for another minute.</li>
            <li>Once the fried dough balls are golden brown, remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Immediately place the fried balls in the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak in the syrup for at least an hour so that they become soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>Your Gulab Jamun is ready! Serve them warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts if desired.</li>
